## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I am getting better at flexbox but still not very confident. Definitely got a lot of practice manoevering margins and padding, and I started with the mobile verion of the site this time which I think was actually very helpful!!

### Continued development
 
 Still trying to get a handle on flexbox but getting there. Also curious about when div/span are acceptable under semantic html standards.
